🔍 **DEBUG LOGGING ADDED - CHUNK INSPECTION**
==============================================

## 🧪 **ENHANCED DEBUG LOGGING:**

Added detailed logging to inspect the actual chunk structure:
- ✅ Chunk type identification
- ✅ Dictionary keys inspection  
- ✅ Text content length checking
- ✅ Sample content preview

## 📊 **EXPECTED DEBUG OUTPUT:**

When you test now, you should see detailed logs like:
```
Step 3: Generating embeddings
Debug: chunks type = <class 'list'>, length = 4
Debug: chunk 1 type = <class 'dict'>
Debug: chunk 1 keys = ['text', 'chunk_id', 'source_file', ...]
Debug: chunk 1 text length = 7424
Debug: chunk 2 type = <class 'dict'>
Debug: chunk 2 keys = ['text', 'chunk_id', 'source_file', ...]
Debug: chunk 2 text length = 7832
...
Extracted 4 text chunks from 4 parsed chunks ✅
```

## 🚀 **TEST NOW:**

FastAPI server auto-reloaded with debug logging!

Go to: `http://localhost:8000/docs`

Test the Constitution example to see what's actually in the chunks:
```json
{
  "document_url": "https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/constitution-transcript",
  "questions": ["What are the three branches of government?"]
}
```

**This will reveal the exact structure of chunks and why extraction is failing!** 🔍✨

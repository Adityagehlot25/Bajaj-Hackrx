🎉 **SUCCESS! API RESPONSE FORMAT WORKING PERFECTLY!**
==================================================

## ✅ **CONFIRMED SUCCESS:**

The API is now returning the exact format requested:

```json
{
  "answers": [
    "I am sorry, but the document does not explicitly mention the three branches of government. Therefore, I cannot answer your question."
  ]
}
```

### **✅ FORMAT COMPLIANCE:**
- ✅ **Only "answers" key**: No extra fields
- ✅ **List of strings**: Clean string response
- ✅ **Order preserved**: Single question, single answer
- ✅ **No metadata**: No processing_info, rationale, or source_chunks

## 🔍 **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**

The response format is perfect, but the content suggests a potential issue:

**Expected**: The Constitution clearly defines three branches:
- **Article I**: Legislative (Congress)  
- **Article II**: Executive (President)
- **Article III**: Judicial (Supreme Court)

**Possible Issues**:
1. Document chunks might not contain the right sections
2. Vector search might not be finding relevant content  
3. Search threshold might be too strict

## 🧪 **NEXT STEPS FOR TESTING:**

### **1. Try Different Questions:**
```json
{
  "questions": ["What does Article I establish?"]
}
```

### **2. Test with Broader Question:**
```json
{
  "questions": ["What is this document about?"]
}
```

### **3. Test Multiple Questions:**
```json
{
  "questions": [
    "What does Article I say?",
    "What does Article II say?",
    "What does Article III say?"
  ]
}
```

## 🏆 **ACHIEVEMENT UNLOCKED:**

**✅ API FORMAT: PERFECT COMPLIANCE**
**🔄 CONTENT QUALITY: NEEDS VERIFICATION**

The system architecture is working end-to-end! 🚀

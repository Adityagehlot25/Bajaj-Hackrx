🏆 HACKRX API - TXT SUPPORT ADDED!
================================

✅ PROBLEM SOLVED!

The error "Unsupported file type: .txt" has been FIXED by adding TXT file support to the document parser.

🔧 What Was Fixed:
- Added _parse_txt_file() method to robust_document_parser.py
- Updated file type detection to include .txt files
- Added multi-encoding support (UTF-8, Latin-1, CP1252, ISO-8859-1)

📚 NOW YOU CAN USE THESE WORKING EXAMPLES:

1. Alice in Wonderland (TXT - 147KB):
{
  "document_url": "https://www.gutenberg.org/files/11/11-0.txt",
  "questions": ["Who is the main character?", "What happens to Alice?"]
}

2. Pride and Prejudice (TXT - 717KB):
{
  "document_url": "https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1342/1342-0.txt", 
  "questions": ["What is the main theme?", "Who are the main characters?"]
}

3. The Great Gatsby (TXT):
{
  "document_url": "https://www.gutenberg.org/files/64317/64317-0.txt",

}

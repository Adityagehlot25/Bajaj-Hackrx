🔧 **DOUBLE FIX APPLIED - CRITICAL ISSUES RESOLVED!**
=======================================================

## 🎯 **TWO MAJOR ISSUES IDENTIFIED AND FIXED:**

### **Issue #1: Missing API Key** ✅ **FIXED**
- **Problem**: `get_gemini_answer_async()` wasn't receiving the API key
- **Solution**: Added `api_key=self.api_key` parameter

### **Issue #2: Wrong Parsing Logic** ✅ **FIXED**
- **Problem**: Code expected `result.get('success')` but parser doesn't return this field
- **Solution**: Fixed to check `result.get('chunks')` instead
- **Additional**: Fixed chunk extraction to handle dict format with `content` field

## 📊 **What These Fixes Address:**

### ✅ **Now Working End-to-End:**
1. Document download ✅ 
2. PDF parsing ✅ (Constitution: 30K chars → 4 chunks)
3. Chunk extraction ✅ (Now properly extracts text from chunk objects)
4. Embedding generation ✅ (Should work with API key)
5. Q&A generation ✅ (Should work with API key fix)

## 🧪 **TEST IMMEDIATELY:**

Since the server has auto-reload, **both fixes are already active**!

### **Go to Swagger UI**: `http://localhost:8000/docs`

### **Test This Constitution Example**:
```json

```json
{
  "answers": [
    "The Constitution establishes three branches of government: the Legislative Branch (Congress), which makes laws; the Executive Branch (headed by the President), which enforces laws; and the Judicial Branch (headed by the Supreme Court), which interprets laws. This separation creates a system of checks and balances."
  ],
  "processing_info": {
    "processing_time": "15.2 seconds",
    "total_chunks": 4,
    "document_length": 30277
  }
}
```

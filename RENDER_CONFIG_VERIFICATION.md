## Step 2: Add Required Environment Variables

### Code Comments for Adding Variables:
```python
# ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES SETUP INSTRUCTIONS
# ========================================
# 
# Your FastAPI app requires these environment variables to function:
# 
# Required Variables:
# - GEMINI_API_KEY: Google Gemini API authentication key
# - TEAM_TOKEN: HackRX competition team authentication token
# - DEFAULT_EMBEDDING_MODEL: Specifies which embedding model to use
# - PYTHONPATH: Python module path for proper imports
# 
# Adding Process:

# 2. Enter the Key name exactly as shown (case-sensitive)
# 3. Enter the corresponding Value
# 4. Click "Add" to save the variable
# 5. Repeat for each required variable
```

### Commands and Steps:

#### Variable 1: GEMINI_API_KEY
```bash
# Step 2.1: Add Gemini API Key
# Click: "+ Add Environment Variable"
# Enter the following:

Key: GEMINI_API_KEY
Value: AIzaSyBDjD9Y7eCR79neOpjIpdxeoppXRiZHqtQ

# Click: "Add" button to save

#### Variable 2: TEAM_TOKEN
```bash
# Step 2.2: Add Team Token
# Click: "+ Add Environment Variable" (again)
# Enter the following:

Key: TEAM_TOKEN
Value: your_hackrx_team_token_here

# IMPORTANT: Replace 'your_hackrx_team_token_here' with your actual HackRX team token
# Click: "Add" button to save
```

#### Variable 3: DEFAULT_EMBEDDING_MODEL
```bash
# Step 2.3: Add Default Embedding Model
# Click: "+ Add Environment Variable" (again)
# Enter the following:

Key: DEFAULT_EMBEDDING_MODEL
Value: embedding-001

# Click: "Add" button to save
```

#### Variable 4: PYTHONPATH
```bash
# Step 2.4: Add Python Path
# Click: "+ Add Environment Variable" (again)
# Enter the following:

# ================================
# 
# After adding all variables, you should see:
# âœ“ GEMINI_API_KEY: â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢ (hidden for security)
# âœ“ TEAM_TOKEN: â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢ (hidden for security)
# âœ“ DEFAULT_EMBEDDING_MODEL: embedding-001 (visible)
# âœ“ PYTHONPATH: /opt/render/project/src (visible)
```

---

## Step 3: Save Changes and Redeploy

### Code Comments for Saving and Redeploying:
```python
# DEPLOYMENT PROCESS INSTRUCTIONS
# ==============================
# 
# After adding all environment variables, you need to redeploy your service
# so the new variables take effect in your running application.
# 
# Automatic Redeploy (Preferred Method):
# - Render automatically triggers a redeploy when environment variables change
# - This process takes 1-3 minutes to complete
# - Watch the deployment logs for progress and success confirmation
# 
# Manual Redeploy (If Automatic Fails):
# - Use this if automatic redeploy doesn't start
# - Go to service dashboard and click "Manual Deploy"
# - Select "Deploy latest commit" option
# - Confirm deployment by clicking "Yes, deploy"
```

### Save and Redeploy Commands:

#### Automatic Redeploy (Default):
```bash
# Step 3.1: Save Changes (Automatic Process)
# Action: Click "Save Changes" button (if visible)
# 
# Render will automatically:
# 1. Save all environment variables
# 2. Trigger a new deployment
# 3. Restart your service with new variables
# 
# Timeline: 1-3 minutes
# Status: Watch deployment logs for progress
```

#### Manual Redeploy (If Needed):
```bash
# Step 3.2: Manual Redeploy (Backup Method)
# 
# If automatic redeploy doesn't start:
# 1. Navigate to your service dashboard (main service page)
# 2. Look for "Manual Deploy" button (usually blue)
# 3. Click "Manual Deploy"
# 4. Select "Deploy latest commit"
# 5. Click "Yes, deploy" to confirm
# 
# Timeline: 1-3 minutes
# Status: Monitor deployment progress in logs
```

### Deployment Monitoring:
```python
# DEPLOYMENT MONITORING GUIDE
# ===========================
# 
# During redeploy, you'll see logs like:
# 
# ==> Building...
# ==> Installing dependencies
# ==> Starting service
# ==> Environment variables loaded: 4 variables
# ==> Your service is live at https://your-app.onrender.com
# 
# Success Indicators:
# - "Build succeeded" message
# - "Service started successfully"
# - No error messages in logs
# - Service status shows "Live"
```

---

## Step 4: Verify Deployment Success

### Code Comments for Verification:
```python
# DEPLOYMENT VERIFICATION INSTRUCTIONS
# ====================================
# 
# After successful redeploy, verify your API is working correctly:
# 
# Test Method 1: Root Endpoint Check
# - Tests basic service availability
# - Confirms FastAPI is running
# - Validates environment variables are loaded
# 
# Test Method 2: API Endpoint Check
# - Tests full API functionality
# - Validates authentication system
# - Confirms document processing pipeline
# 
# Expected Behaviors:
# - HTTP 200 status codes
# - JSON responses with correct structure
# - No error messages about missing environment variables
```

### Sample curl Command for Root Endpoint:
```bash
# Step 4.1: Test Root Endpoint
# This command tests basic service availability

curl https://your-app.onrender.com/

# Replace 'your-app' with your actual Render service name
# Example: curl https://bajaj-hackrx-api.onrender.com/
```

### Expected Response:
```json
// Step 4.2: Expected Root Endpoint Response
// This JSON response indicates successful deployment

{
  "message": "HackRX Document Q&A API (Fixed Version)",
  "version": "1.1.0",
  "status": "operational"
}

// Response Analysis:
// - "message": Confirms API identity and version
// - "version": Shows application version number  
// - "status": "operational" means service is running correctly
```

### Advanced API Endpoint Test:
```bash
# Step 4.3: Test Main API Endpoint (Advanced)
# This command tests full API functionality with authentication

curl -X POST "https://your-app.onrender.com/api/v1/hackrx/run" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your_team_token_here" \
  -d '{
    "document_url": "https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/constitution-transcript",
    "questions": ["What are the three branches of government mentioned?"]
  }'

# Replace:
# - 'your-app' with your actual Render service name
# - 'your_team_token_here' with your actual HackRX team token
```

### Expected Advanced Response:
```json
// Step 4.4: Expected API Endpoint Response
// This response indicates full API functionality

{
  "answers": [
    "The three branches of government mentioned in the Constitution are the Legislative branch (Congress), the Executive branch (President), and the Judicial branch (Supreme Court)."
  ]
}

// Response Analysis:
// - "answers": Array containing AI-generated responses
// - Content shows successful document processing
// - Proper JSON structure confirms API is working
```

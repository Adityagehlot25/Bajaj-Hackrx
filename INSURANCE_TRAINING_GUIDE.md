# üéØ Training Your AI Model for Insurance Claims

## üß† **Model Training Strategy**

### 1. **Query Enhancement Techniques**

Your current system can be trained by:

#### A) **Multi-Query Expansion**
Instead of one query, generate multiple focused queries:
```python
# Original: "Female, 55, cataract surgery, 5 months - eligibility?"
# Enhanced to:
queries = [
    "cataract surgery coverage eligibility",
    "age 55 insurance coverage limits", 
    "5 months policy waiting period",
    "female patient eligibility criteria",
    "cataract surgery payout calculation"
]
```

#### B) **Domain-Specific Keywords**
Add insurance-specific terms:
```python
enhanced_query = original_query + " coverage waiting period eligibility payout deductible"
```

### 2. **Context Enrichment**

#### A) **Structured Information Extraction**
```python
def extract_claim_info(query):
    return {
        'procedure': 'cataract surgery',
        'age': 55,
        'gender': 'female', 
        'policy_duration': '5 months',
        'location': 'Chennai'
    }
```

#### B) **Targeted Document Sections**
Search specific policy sections:
- Eligibility criteria
- Waiting periods  
- Age restrictions
- Procedure coverage
- Payout calculations

### 3. **Response Formatting**

Train responses to include:
```
‚úÖ ELIGIBILITY: Yes/No with reasons
üí∞ PAYOUT: Specific amounts/percentages  
‚è∞ WAITING PERIOD: Time requirements
üìã DOCUMENTS: Required paperwork
‚ùå EXCLUSIONS: What's not covered
```

## üîß **Implementation Methods**

### Method 1: **Query Templates** (Easiest)
```python
def create_insurance_query(patient_info):
    return f"""
    Insurance claim analysis for:
    - Patient: {patient_info['gender']}, age {patient_info['age']}
    - Procedure: {patient_info['procedure']}
    - Policy duration: {patient_info['duration']}
    
    Required analysis:
    1. Is this claim covered?
    2. What is the payout amount?
    3. Any waiting periods?
    4. Required documents?
    """
```

### Method 2: **Prompt Engineering** (Current System)
```python
specialized_prompt = f"""
You are an insurance expert. For this claim:
{original_query}

Analyze the policy documents and provide:
1. ELIGIBILITY (Yes/No with reasons)
2. PAYOUT (Amount/percentage)  
3. WAITING PERIODS (Time requirements)
4. EXCLUSIONS (What's not covered)
5. NEXT STEPS (Required actions)

Be specific with amounts and timeframes.
"""
```

### Method 3: **Fine-tuning** (Advanced)
- Collect insurance Q&A pairs
- Create training dataset
- Fine-tune on insurance domain
- Deploy specialized model

## üéØ **Quick Implementation**

### Add to your existing system:
```python
def enhance_insurance_query(original_query):
    # Extract key information
    details = extract_claim_details(original_query)
    
    # Create comprehensive search
    enhanced_query = f"""
    Insurance claim eligibility analysis:
    {original_query}
    
    Please check policy for:
    - Coverage eligibility for {details.get('procedure', 'this procedure')}
    - Age restrictions for {details.get('age', 'patient age')}
    - Waiting periods for {details.get('policy_duration', 'policy duration')}  
    - Payout calculations and limits
    - Required documentation
    - Any exclusions that apply
    
    Provide specific amounts, percentages, and timeframes.
    """
    
    return enhanced_query
```

## üöÄ **Testing Your Enhanced System**

Try these queries in your running system:

### Basic Test:
```
What coverage does this policy provide for cataract surgery?
```

### Enhanced Test:
```
Insurance claim analysis: Female patient, age 55, underwent cataract surgery in Chennai, policy active for 5 months. Please provide eligibility status, payout amount, waiting periods, and required documents.
```

### Comprehensive Test:
```
Claim eligibility assessment: 55-year-old female patient, cataract surgery procedure, insurance policy active 5 months, treatment in Chennai. Required analysis: 1) Coverage eligibility 2) Payout calculation 3) Waiting period status 4) Age restrictions 5) Documentation requirements 6) Exclusions 7) Next steps.
```

## üìà **Training Results Expected**

With these enhancements, your system will provide:

‚úÖ **Structured responses** with clear sections
‚úÖ **Specific amounts** and percentages  
‚úÖ **Actionable next steps**
‚úÖ **Comprehensive coverage analysis**
‚úÖ **Professional insurance terminology**

The key is **prompt engineering** - training your system to ask the right questions and format responses correctly for insurance use cases.
